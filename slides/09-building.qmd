## Side-by-Side

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggsurvfit)
library(tidyverse)
```

- You'll often need to place two or more figures side-by-side

- My favorite package to do this is {patchwork}

- But before you can use {patchwork} with {ggsurvfit}, you need to understand a bit about how these figures are constructed

  - The risktables are only added to the figure __during printing__ by calling the `ggsurvfit_build()` function
  
  - This means that you __must build the plot__ before you can cobble figures together
  
- I have an open issue in {patchwork} to add a feature so we can avoid this extra step
  
  
## Side-by-Side

```{r fig.height=3.5}
p <- survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, df_colon) %>%
  ggsurvfit() +
  add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable() +
  scale_ggsurvfit()

# build plot (which constructs the risktable)
built_p <- ggsurvfit_build(p) |> patchwork::wrap_plots()

# I am hoping in the future was can just call `p | p`
built_p | built_p   
```
