## Survival Analysis

> Survival times are data that measure follow-up time from a defined starting point to the occurrence of a given event, for example the time from the beginning to the end of a remission period or the time from the diagnosis of a disease to death. Standard statistical techniques cannot usually be applied because the data are often 'censored'. A survival time is described as censored when there is a follow-up time but the event has not yet occurred.
