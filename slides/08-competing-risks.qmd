## Competing Risks

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggsurvfit)
library(tidyverse)
```

- There is another _flavor_ of survival data referred to as competing risks data.

- The most common type of a competing risk is an event that drives the probability of observing our event of interest to zero.

- For example, if we are interested in model the time from a treatment to a disease's return or recurrence...what do we do if a patient passes away from an unrelated cause?

- In this case, death from other causes is a competing event.

- The {ggsurvfit} package plays nicely with the {tidycmprsk} package for competing risks analysis.

Well that sounds confusing!

## Competing Risks

```{r}
tidycmprsk::cuminc(Surv(ttdeath, death_cr) ~ trt, tidycmprsk::trial) %>%
  ggcuminc(outcome = "death from cancer") +
  add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable() +
  scale_ggsurvfit()
